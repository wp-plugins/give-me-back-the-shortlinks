This plugin will display the shortlink menu item in the editorial pages & admin toolbar, for both Pages & Custom Post Types

== Description ==

Give Me Back the Page & Custom Shortlinks! A very simple plugin that will add the shortlinks button under the content title also for Pages & Custom Post Types, and also activate the Shortlinks in the Admin Bar for those Post types. Wordpress's default is shortlinking only the posts, but don't ask me why... 

== Installation ==

1. Upload this plugin directory to `/wp-content/plugins/` 
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Activate permalinks in the settings menu

That's all, folks! Don't Expect an Admin page, cause we don't need any.
